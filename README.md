# Time's Pixel

Time's Pixel is a data visualization project that blends meteorological data with artistic expression. By using daily sunrise, sunset, and moon time data from Hong Kong, the project transforms temporal patterns into visual art, exploring the rhythm of nature and the passage of time through creative coding.

## Project Vision

This project aims to:
- Visualize the interplay between sunlight and moonlight over the course of a year.
- Express the concept of time as a mosaic or pixelated artwork, where each day is a unique pixel shaped by natural phenomena.
- Encourage viewers to reflect on the cyclical beauty of time and its impact on our environment.

## Data Source

The primary dataset is sourced from the Hong Kong Observatory's open data API:
- [Sunrise, Sunset, and Moon Time Data (2024)](https://data.weather.gov.hk/weatherAPI/opendata/opendata.php?dataType=SRS&year=2024&rformat=csv)

This dataset includes:
- Daily sunrise and sunset times
- Duration of daylight
- Moonrise and moonset times

## Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**: Download and preprocess the CSV data to ensure accuracy and usability.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Parse and structure the data to extract sunrise, sunset, daylight duration, and moon time.
3. **Creative Visualization**: Develop an artistic representation using the processed data, experimenting with pixel art, generative patterns, or other visual metaphors.

## Artistic Approach

The visualization will treat each day as a pixel, colored and shaped by its unique solar and lunar timings. The result will be a tapestry of time, revealing hidden patterns and inviting new interpretations of daily cycles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions to download and clean the data.
3. Run the visualization script to generate the artwork.
